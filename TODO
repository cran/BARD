Todo:
 - Rgenoud cluster tuning
 - Miniball upgrade
 - ASA port
 - ASA parallel
 - Memory leak in plot.polylist investigate (workaround in place)
 - NULL changelists in score functions
 - compare plans different basemaps, ndists
 - bias/responsiveness
 - tune annealing initial params
 - re-annealing
 - tune genoud operators, generations, population size
 - tune TABU search -- tabulist based on single/bidirectional, full list
 - dynamic score tuning in Tabu
 - option for flat areas in greedy search
 - profiling cluster optimizations across samples
 - allow double exchanges
 - block-level incremental moment scores
 - CRS projections
 -  Compare plans w/differnt districts
 - as.data.frame <- data frame update methods
- create arealist, perimeter, joint perimeter list for performance
 - total score in simulated annealing, keep best plan, temperature
 - checkpoint during plan profiling
 - performance: contiguous plan in N
 - memory leak in greedy? in C?
 - createContiguousPlan --> performance drops as ndists increase, profile, include bbox time
 - profile greedy
