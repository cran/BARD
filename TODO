Todo:
- HTML output refinements - report crosstabs
 ftable/xtable
	- dynamic scores for splitScore
	- index calculation timing
         - block equivalency/distcit id conversion
        - get projection string with -- warning/use rGDal
	- simile data
	- shape optimizations

 merge generic, [.dataframe
Incumbency protection function
population heatmap
Anneal on non-assigned?
perimeter pre-indexing
miniball pre-indexing

- more compactness options with keepgeom=FALSE
- Rgenoud cluster tuning
- Population score method tuning
- checkpoint during plan profiling
- Miniball upgrade
- Memory leak in plot.polylist investigate (workaround in place)
- NULL changelists in score functions
- compare plans different basemaps, ndists
- tune genoud operators, generations, population size
- dynamic score tuning in Tabu
- option for flat areas in greedy search
- profiling cluster optimizations across samples
- allow double exchanges
- block-level incremental moment scores
- Compare plans w/differnt districts
- data frame update methods
- memory leak in greedy? in C?
- createContiguousPlan --> performance drops as ndists increase, profile, include bbox time
- profile greedy
- bias/responsiveness scores
- tune TABU search -- tabulist based on single/bidirectional, full list
